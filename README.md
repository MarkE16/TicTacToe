# TicTacToe
A small game I created with Java in my free time.

---
## How do I run this?
- Download the ZIP.
- Extract the contents.
- Navigate to the `src` directory.
- Run `javac Main.java`.
- If you run the command with no issues, then the code was successfully compiled, thus now being able to run `java Main` to execute the game.
